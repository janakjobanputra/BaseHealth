Hello,

All of the code is listed below. It is in the form of a python script. The output can be seen when run in a unix shell. To run the code, please use the following line: "python apiCall2.py"

I converted the csv data file you had given me into a json filetype manually, so that I can input it to the python script.

Thank you for the interesting homework!
